the workflow in action
1-A user's support request is sent from another backend and arrives as a message in a RabbitMQ queue.
2- An available AI worker picks up the message.
3-The worker first queries the Redis cache to see if a result for this input already exists.
4- If a result is found in Redis (Cache Hit): The cached ticket and solution are retrieved and the process is complete. This provides a near-instantaneous response.
5-if no result is in Redis (Cache Miss):
    The worker sends the user's input to your Hugging Face model being served by vLLM.
    vLLM processes the request and returns the structured JSON output (the ticket and solution).
    The worker then stores this new result in Redis for future requests.
6-The final JSON output is then passed on to the next stage of your banking workflow (e.g., stored in a database, sent to a human agent's dashboard, etc.).
